 	 step5 -> end.
 	 
Question: write an algorithm to a given number is prime or composite.

Algorithm:
	step1 -> start
	
	step2 -> create an integer n and assign its value.
	
	step3 -> create variables like integer i=2,and boolean prime = true. 
	
	step4 -> take a loop where i<n,i++ and if n%i==0 make the prime = false.
	
	step5 -> if prime is true then print as "N is prime number".
	
	step6 -> else print as "N is composite number".
	
	step7 -> end.

	step2 -> create an integer variable as n and also sum =0.
	
	step3 -> take a loop where i=1,i<=n and i++.
	
	step4 -> check if condition i%2==0 change the value of sum = sum + i.
	
	step5 -> else continue to loop.
	
	step6 ->print sum.
	
	step7 ->end.
	
Question : write an algorithm to find GCD of two numbers?

Algorithm : 
	step1 -> start
	
	step2 -> create two integers as a,b and initalise its values.
	
	step3 -> And also create integer variable as GCD and assign its value as 1.
	
	step4 -> take a loop where integer i=1,i<=a && i<=b and i++.
	
	step5 -> check these conditions inside the loop if a%i==0 && b%i==0.
	
	step6 -> if the condition is true change the gcd value to i.
	
	step7 -> print gcd.
	
	step8 ->end.
	
Question : write an algorithm print prime number till given n?
 
 Algorithm :
          step1 -> start.
          
          step2 -> create a integer variable n and read its value.
          
          step3 -> take a loop with integer variable i=1;i<=n and i++.
          
          step4 -> Inside the loop create a boolean variable as true and j=2.
          
          step5 -> then take a loop with condition j<i and check the condition inside this loop as if n%i==0 set value of the boolean variable as false else true.
          
          step6 -> j++. in outer loop check if the boolean value is true print i.
          
          step7 -> end.
        
Question : write an algorithm to print fibonacci series till n?

Algorithm : 
	step1 -> start.
