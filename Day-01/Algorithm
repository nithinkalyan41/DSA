	Algorithm:
	
	step1 -> create a text file with the extension of filename.java and create a class in the that file with the same filename.
	
	step2 -> create main method inside the class.And declare a variable N=5.
	
	step3 -> declare another variable with the name of answer and its value is 0.
	
	step4 -> Take a for loop intialise the value of i=1, loop condition i<=n and i++;
	
	step5 -> change the value of sum = sum + i.
	
	step6 -> print the sum.
	
	step7 -> Execute the program.
