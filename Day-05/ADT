Abstract Data Type (ADT)

	--> Primtive data types in java are INT,FLOAT,BYTE,CHAR,DOUBLE,BOOLEAN,SHORT,LONG these are used to store atomic values such as
	 smaller and single value and we can to basic Arthematic operations.
	
	--> Complex data types in java are LIST,STACK,QUEUE,SET etc., where these are used to store set of values and to make set of set of operations.

	These kind of complex datatypes can be known as abstract data types.the abstract datatypes can be provided in inbulit libraries of java and if any
	necessary user can create as per his requirements.

	--> Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.
	
	Abstraction in simple words hiding the internal implementation of program and only shows the required essentials to user.
	this abstraction can be used programming to hide the business logic and restricting the user to make changes of source code an application.
	
	project -> sourcecode -> compile -> jarfile
	
	Advantages of ADT :
		->Encapsulation
		->Robust
		->Abstraction
		->DataStructure Independence
		->Information Hiding
		->Modularity
	Disadvantages of ADT :
		->Overhead
		->Complexity
		->Learning
		->Cost
